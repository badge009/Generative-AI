              "'\\nWrite a summary of the following speech:\\nSpeech:\\nAcross the country, countless individuals—from government officials to community leaders—are working tirelessly to shape a better tomorrow. They are the driving force behind initiatives that aim to uplift the underprivileged, bring governance closer to the people, and ensure that no one is left behind. I stand before you today not just as a leader but as your humble servant, committed to the vision of a prosperous, self-reliant, and empowered India.\\n\\nOver the years, governments have launched numerous welfare programs. Policies have been drafted, funds have been allocated, and promises have been made. But what truly matters is whether these efforts reach the people who need them the most. It is not enough to have ambitious schemes on paper; they must translate into real change on the ground—transforming lives, bringing dignity, and ensuring opportunities for all.\\n\\nTake, for instance, housing for the poor. For years, families have struggled in slums and makeshift shelters. If there is a housing scheme, should they be forced to navigate bureaucratic hurdles, running from one office to another? No. The government must go to them, not the other way around. And today, because of this commitment, millions of families now have permanent homes, bringing them security and stability. But we must ensure that not a single deserving family is left behind. That is why I believe in personally reaching out, listening, and ensuring that every household benefits from these initiatives.\\n\\nSimilarly, consider healthcare. A nation’s progress is meaningless if its citizens are burdened by the fear of medical expenses. I recently met a young father who had lost all hope after a severe accident. He told me, “Without financial support, I could never have afforded my treatment.” But thanks to the Ayushman Bharat scheme, he underwent life-saving surgery without worrying about the cost. Today, he stands before me healthy, ready to provide for his family. These are not just statistics; these are lives transformed.\\n\\nThe success of such programs does not lie in their mere existence but in their implementation with integrity. Corruption, inefficiency, and red tape should never be barriers between the people and their rights. That is why I urge every official, every policymaker, and every citizen to uphold transparency and ensure that help reaches where it is truly needed.\\n\\nOur ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ is not just a journey—it is a mission of accountability. It is a test to see whether we have delivered on our promises. It is a reminder that governance is not about sitting in offices but about being present in the lives of the people.\\n\\nAnd what is the true success of any nation? It is when a poor mother can cook a warm meal for her children without inhaling harmful smoke. When a widow receives her rightful financial support without struggling. When a child from a humble background can dream big, knowing that opportunities are open to him just as they are to others.\\n\\nFor decades, we have spoken about removing poverty. But true development is not just about removing poverty; it is about ensuring dignity, equity, and empowerment. It is about erasing the barriers that divide the rich and the poor. When a family gains access to basic necessities—housing, healthcare, education, and clean energy—the distinction between privilege and struggle begins to fade.\\n\\nThat is the vision we must strive for. A self-reliant, inclusive, and just nation—where development is not a privilege of the few but a right of every citizen.\\n\\nLet us walk this path together. Let us ensure that no voice goes unheard, no need goes unmet, and no dream goes unfulfilled. This is not just a government’s responsibility—it is our collective duty.\\n\\nTranslate the precise summary to bangla\\n'"

Accelerate development : Aspiration of the youth, \\n \\n2. Empower villages, \\n \\n3. Mobilize rural core competence for competitiveness, \\n \\n4. Seed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth \\n \\n5. Defeat problems and succeed, \\n \\n6. Overcome problems through partnership, \\n \\n7. Courage in combating calamities, \\n \\n8.

Youth movement for Developed India 2020. \\n \\nNow let me share with you each of the messages. \\n \\nAccelerate Development: Aspiration of the youth \\nWhile there were many significant events during my tenure, a question from a little girl \\nAnukriti of Sri Sathya Sai Jagriti Vidya Mandir School, of Dar wa village from Haryana, \\nduring children’s visit to Rashtrapati Bhavan on May 22, 2006, rings in my  mind ever \\nafter. \\n \\nAnukriti asked me “why India cannot become a developed nation before the year 2020”. I \\nappreciated the question and said it was indeed a thoughtful question and assured her that \\nthat her dream would be taken to the highest institution of the nation and we would work'),\n",

This question reflects how the desire t o live in developed \\nIndia has entered into the minds of the youth. The same feelings are  echoed by over \\nfifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the drea m of the 540 \\nmillion youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after my assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'source': '/content/apjspeech.pdf', 'page': 2, 'page_label': '3'}, page_content='Let me now share with you, the enriching experience I had, whil e meeting more than \\n6000 farmers from different States and Union Territories visitin g Rashtrapati Bhavan. \\nThey evinced keen interest in the Mughal Gardens, the Herbal Gardens , the Spiritual \\nGarden, the Musical Garden, the Bio-diesel garden and the Nutrition Garden and interact \\nwith the Horticultural specialists. Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation. We should em power the \\nfarmers to protect and nurture the fertile land for second green re volution. Meeting the \\nScientists and the Farmers has given me the confidence \\nthat the nation is poised to increase the agricultural GDP growth by atleast 4% per annum \\nthrough the partnership of farmers and agricultural scientists a nd industries particularly \\nfor value addition. \\n \\nDefeat the problems and succeed \\nOn the evening of February 24, 2007, at Coimbatore, I had a very beautiful experience. \\nAs I got ready for meeting the first person out of twenty appoint ments, a wheel chair was \\nin sight with a smiling person probably in his late fifties; unfortunately he has no hands \\nand legs. His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the parents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area.

As per the district authorities the impact of the  training on the students is \\nvisible in terms of self-discipline, love for their parents and tea chers shedding of stage \\nfear and recognition of their duties towards the nation.

This question reflects how the desire t o live in developed \\nIndia has entered into the minds of the youth. The same feelings are  echoed by over \\nfifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the drea m of the 540 \\nmillion youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after my assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation. We should em power the \\nfarmers to protect and nurture the fertile land for second green re volution. Meeting the \\nScientists and the Farmers has given me the confidence \\nthat the nation is poised to increase the agricultural GDP growth by atleast 4% per annum \\nthrough the partnership of farmers and agricultural scientists a nd industries particularly \\nfor value addition. \\n \\nDefeat the problems and succeed \\nOn the evening of February 24, 2007, at Coimbatore, I had a very beautiful experience. \\nAs I got ready for meeting the first person out of twenty appoint ments, a wheel chair was \\nin sight with a smiling person probably in his late fifties; unfortunately he has no hands \\nand legs. His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the parents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area. When I went there, I found that the school building had been severely damaged. \\nI met all the school children and the village citizen of Urusa. The villagers apprised me of \\ntheir losses and had all praise for Army and Air Force role in rescue and relief operations \\nalong with state government. I appreciate the courage of the people of Urusa in defeating \\ntheir problems. They have actually become the master of the probl em rather than \\nallowing problems to become their master.

Even thoug h there were many \\nhuman losses due to the Tsunami of 26 Dec 2004, the tribal islanders had  taken \\npossession of affected victims as their children and there is nothi ng like orphanage in \\nCar-Nicobar Islands.

He expresses his gratitude to the people of India and shares his experiences and interactions with various segments of society, including politicians, scientists, academics, and youth. He highlights 10 important messages that he wants to convey, including:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. Accelerating development and fulfilling the aspirations of the youth\n",
            "2. Empowering villages and rural areas\n",
            "3. Overcoming problems through partnerships and courage\n",
            "4. Defending the nation and promoting patriotism\n",
            "5. Fostering a youth movement for a developed India by 2020\n",
            "\n",
            "He specifically recalls a question from a young girl named Anukriti, who asked why India couldn't become a developed nation before 2020. Kalam appreciated the question and assured her that it was a thoughtful one, implying that he believes India has the potential to achieve this goal with collective effort and determination. The speech is a reflection on his tenure and a call to action for the people of India to work together towards a brighter future.\n",
            "\n",
            "The speaker appreciated the question, found it thoughtful, and assured that the matter would be taken to the highest national institution and worked on.\n",
            "\n",
            "The speech appears to be from a former President of India, likely APJ Abdul Kalam. The main points of the speech are:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. The youth of India aspire to live in a developed and prosperous country, and this desire should guide their professional contributions.\n",
            "2. The speaker shares an experience from a visit to a village in Nagaland, where they saw an empowered village council functioning effectively, but noted the need for better physical connectivity to markets.\n",
            "3. The speaker highlights the potential for transformation in India's 600,000 villages if they are empowered to manage their own development and connected to urban societies.\n",
            "4. The speaker cites the example of the Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women's initiative to provide urban amenities in rural areas (PURA) as a model for rural development, which has led to employment generation and entrepreneurship.\n",
            "\n",
            "Overall, the speech emphasizes the importance of empowering villages and providing connectivity to unlock the potential of rural India and achieve a prosperous and developed nation.\n",
            "\n",
            "The speech discusses the success of a rural development model called PURA (Provision of Urban Amenities to Rural Areas), which has been implemented in a region with the help of self-help groups and technological support from an engineering college. The model has led to:\n",
            "\n",
            "* Employment generation and entrepreneurship\n",
            "* Development of waste land into cultivable land\n",
            "* Cultivation of various crops, power generation, and food processing\n",
            "* Creation of marketing centers\n",
            "\n",
            "Additionally, the region has collaborated with experts from Japan to develop 55 lifestyle products that are internationally competitive. The speaker believes that this model can be replicated in other states to bridge the rural-urban divide, and estimates that 7000 such PURA initiatives are needed across the country.\n",
            "\n",
            "The speech discusses two main experiences of the speaker. \n",
            "\n",
            "Firstly, the speaker shares their experience of meeting over 6,000 farmers from different states and union territories at Rashtrapati Bhavan. The farmers showed interest in various gardens and interacted with horticultural specialists. The speaker emphasizes the need to double agricultural production with reduced resources and improve the economic conditions of the nation. They express confidence that the nation can increase agricultural GDP growth by at least 4% per annum through the partnership of farmers, scientists, and industries.\n",
            "\n",
            "Secondly, the speaker recounts a meeting with a disabled person, Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, who was born without hands and legs. Despite his physical limitations, Krishna Murthy exudes confidence and happiness, attributing it to the support of his family, teachers, and others. He asks to sing in front of the speaker, demonstrating his positive attitude and determination to overcome his challenges. The speech appears to be inspiring and motivational, encouraging the audience to defeat problems and succeed.\n",
            "\n",
            "The speech highlights two inspiring stories of resilience and determination. \n",
            "\n",
            "The first story is about a physically challenged person who, despite his limitations, has developed a remarkable talent for music. With the support of his parents, teachers, and others, he has been able to blossom and now wants to share his gift with others to inspire them. He even performed at the Rashtra Pati Bhavan art theatre in 2007.\n",
            "\n",
            "The second story is about the people of Urusa village in Jammu & Kashmir, who were affected by a devastating earthquake in 2005. Despite the severe losses, the villagers showed immense courage and resilience in the face of disaster. They appreciated the role of the Army, Air Force, and state government in rescue and relief operations. The speech praises the people of Urusa for their indomitable spirit and ability to overcome their problems, rather than letting the problems overcome them. The overall message is one of hope, positivity, and the power of human spirit to overcome adversity.\n",
            "\n",
            "The speech discusses the speaker's experiences with courage and resilience in the face of natural disasters and challenges. The speaker describes visiting a village after an earthquake, where they saw children and villagers bravely participating in relief efforts and rebuilding their community. They also share an experience from 2005, where they visited the Car Nicobar Islands after a tsunami and were inspired by the tribal islanders' courage and selflessness in caring for affected victims. The speaker even composed a poem, \"Sea Waves\", which they sang with the villagers, showcasing their enthusiasm and determination to overcome adversity. The speech also mentions the speaker's address to the Pan African Parliament, but the summary provided does not include the content of that section. Overall, the speech highlights the importance of courage, community, and resilience in the face of challenges.\n",
            "\n",
            "The speaker proposed the \"Pan African e-Network\" project at an African Union meeting, aiming to connect 53 African countries through a seamless network (satellite, fiber optics, and wireless) at an estimated cost of $100 million. The project includes:\n",
            "\n",
            "* Connecting 12 universities (7 in India, 5 in Africa) and 17 Super Specialty Hospitals (12 in India, 5 in Africa)\n",
            "* Establishing 53 tele-medicine centers and 53 tele-education centers in Africa\n",
            "* A pilot project has been launched in Ethiopia, with Indira Gandhi National Open University offering an MBA course to 34 Ethiopian students, and specialists from CARE Hospital providing tele-medicine services.\n",
            "\n",
            "The speech appears to be from a prominent Indian leader, possibly the President or Prime Minister. The speech covers three main topics:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **India's global outreach**: The speaker mentions India's collaboration with Africa, specifically the tele-consultation services provided by Hyderabad to a hospital in Addis Ababa, and the plan to connect 53 African countries through the Pan African network.\n",
            "2. **Defending the nation**: The speaker expresses pride in India's defense forces, sharing personal experiences of visiting the Siachen Glacier, traveling in a submarine, and flying in a fighter jet. The speaker acknowledges the sacrifices and dedication of the defense personnel and their families.\n",
            "3. **Youth movement for Developed India 2020**: The speaker mentions meeting a group of citizens in Hyderabad who are working towards transforming the youth into enlightened citizens, as part of the \"Lead India 2020 Foundation\".\n",
            "\n",
            "Overall, the speech highlights India's global collaborations, national pride in its defense forces, and the importance of empowering the youth to contribute to the country's development.\n",
            "\n",
            "The speech discusses the importance of transforming India's youth into enlightened citizens. It highlights the work of the Lead India 2020 Foundation, which is training thousands of students in Andhra Pradesh in partnership with the district administration. The speaker cites examples of the positive impact of this training, including increased self-discipline, love for parents and teachers, and a sense of duty towards the nation. The speaker believes that empowering the 540 million youth below the age of 25 through value-based education and leadership is crucial for the country's progress. The speech concludes by emphasizing the richness of Indian tradition and the efforts being made by various agencies to promote unity and cultural diversity.\n",
            "\n",
            "The speech emphasizes the importance of preserving India's cultural heritage and natural resources while pursuing economic growth. The speaker expresses confidence that India can become a developed nation by 2020, driven by the power of its 540 million youth. The speech highlights the need for empowerment and equal opportunities for all, particularly in education. The speaker outlines a vision for a developed India with five key features: \n",
            "\n",

            "The overall tone is optimistic, encouraging citizens to work together to achieve this vision and strive for greatness.\n",
            "\n",
            "The speech envisions a nation with the following ideal characteristics:\n",
            "\n",
            "* Access to quality healthcare for all\n",
            "* Responsive, transparent, and corruption-free governance\n",

            "\n",
            "The speech is a conclusion by Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, where he thanks citizens for their support and cooperation over the last five years. He shares his mission to unite the hearts and minds of India's multicultural society, boost self-confidence, and work towards making India a developed nation by 2020. He ends by wishing the citizens well and expressing his commitment to being with them in this mission.\n",
